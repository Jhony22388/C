This program will demonstrate a number of programming concepts using C.
Arrays, struc, conditions, lopps and loop control. 

The program will perfrom the following functions:
-Allow users to enter multiple pairs of x and y coordinates 
-Allow multiple data points to be entered by the user. 
-Once all of the coordinates and labels are entered, calculate distance between each set of points.
-Determine whihc coordinates are closest and furthest to each other out of all the pairs
-The output will contain the text label, and their corresponding relative distances, for the two closest coordinates and the two most distance coodinates.
-The program will also scrub data since only positive numbers will be allowed to be entered
-A text label must be entered for each set of coordinates and the label cannot be used more than once. Coordinate pairs can be used more than once.
